# Expense Tracker

This is a flet desktop application for built to track day to day expenses. 

What is Flet?
Flet is a Python framework that lets you build web, desktop, and mobile apps using a single codebase — all in Python. You don’t need to know HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Think of it like a bridge between Python and Flutter (which is Google's UI toolkit). Instead of writing Dart like you would in Flutter, you use Python, and Flet handles all the UI rendering behind the scenes.
